<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The ID flag (bit 21) in the EFLAGS register indicates support for the CPUID instruction. If a software procedure can set and clear this flag, the processor executing the procedure supports the CPUID instruction. This instruction operates the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode. CPUID returns processor identification and feature information in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.1 The instruction’s output is dependent on the contents of the EAX register upon execution (in some cases, ECX as well). For example, the following pseudocode loads EAX with 00H and causes CPUID to return a Maximum Return Value and the Vendor Identification String in the appropriate registers:</p>
<p>MOV EAX, 00H CPUID</p>
<p>Table 3-17 shows information returned, depending on the initial value loaded into the EAX register. Table 3-18shows the maximum CPUID input value recognized for each family of IA-32 processors on which CPUID is implemented.</p>
<p>Two types of information are returned: basic and extended function information. If a value entered for CPUID.EAX is higher than the maximum input value for basic or extended function for that processor then the data for the highest basic information leaf is returned. For example, using the Intel Core i7 processor, the following is true:CPUID.EAX = 05H (* Returns MONITOR/MWAIT leaf. *)CPUID.EAX = 0AH (* Returns Architectural Performance Monitoring leaf. *)CPUID.EAX = 0BH (* Returns Extended Topology Enumeration leaf. *)CPUID.EAX = 0CH (* INVALID: Returns the same information as CPUID.EAX = 0BH. *)CPUID.EAX = 80000008H (* Returns linear/physical address size data. *)CPUID.EAX = 8000000AH (* INVALID: Returns same information as CPUID.EAX = 0BH. *)</p>
<p>If a value entered for CPUID.EAX is less than or equal to the maximum input value and the leaf is not supported on that processor then 0 is returned in all the registers. For example, using the Intel Core i7 processor, the following is true:CPUID.EAX = 07H (*Returns EAX=EBX=ECX=EDX=0. *)</p>
<p>When CPUID returns the highest basic leaf information as a result of an invalid input EAX value, any dependence on input ECX value in the basic leaf is honored.</p>
<p>CPUID can be executed at any privilege level to serialize instruction execution. Serializing instruction execution guarantees that any modifications to flags, registers, and memory for previous instructions are completed before the next instruction is fetched and executed.</p>

<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 2, the processor returns information about the processor’s internal TLBs,cache and prefetch hardware in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers. The information is reported in encoded form and fall into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The least-significant byte in register EAX (register AL) indicates the number of times the CPUID instruction must be executed with an input value of 2 to get a complete description of the processor’s TLB/Cache/Prefetch hardware. The Intel Xeon processor 7400 series will return a 1.</li>
	<li>The most significant bit (bit 31) of each register indicates whether the register contains valid information (set to 0) or is reserved (set to 1).</li>
	<li>If a register contains valid information, the information is contained in 1 byte descriptors. There are four types of encoding values for the byte descriptor, the encoding type is noted in the second column of Table 3-22. Table 3-22 lists the encoding of these descriptors. Note that the order of descriptors in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers is not defined; that is, specific bytes are not designated to contain descriptors for specific cache,prefetch, or TLB types. The descriptors may appear in any order. Note also a processor may report a general descriptor type (FFH) and not report any byte descriptor of “cache type” via CPUID leaf 2.</li>

of the family of Pentium 4 processors returns the following information about caches and TLBs when the CPUID executes with an input value of 2:66 5B 50 01H 0H 0H 00 7A 70 00H Which means:The least-significant byte (byte 0) of register EAX is set to 01H. This indicates that CPUID needs to be executed once with an input value of 2 to retrieve complete information about caches and TLBs. The most-significant bit of all four registers (EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX) is set to 0, indicating that each register contains valid 1-byte descriptors. Bytes 1, 2, and 3 of register EAX indicate that the processor has:50H - a 64-entry instruction TLB, for mapping 4-KByte and 2-MByte or 4-MByte pages. 5BH - a 64-entry data TLB, for mapping 4-KByte and 4-MByte pages. 66H - an 8-KByte 1st level data cache, 4-way set associative, with a 64-Byte cache line size. The descriptors in registers EBX and ECX are valid, but contain NULL descriptors. Bytes 0, 1, 2, and 3 of register EDX indicate that the processor has:00H - NULL descriptor. 70H - Trace cache: 12 K-μop, 8-way set associative. 7AH - a 256-KByte 2nd level cache, 8-way set associative, with a sectored, 64-byte cache line size. 00H - NULL descriptor.</td>

<h2 id="input-eax---04h--returns-deterministic-cache-parameters-for-each-level">INPUT EAX = 04H: Returns Deterministic Cache Parameters for Each Level</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 04H and ECX contains an index value, the processor returns encoded data that describe a set of deterministic cache parameters (for the cache level associated with the input in ECX). Valid index values start from 0.</p>
<p>Software can enumerate the deterministic cache parameters for each level of the cache hierarchy starting with an index value of 0, until the parameters report the value associated with the cache type field is 0. The architecturally defined fields reported by deterministic cache parameters are documented in Table 3-17.</p>

<p>The CPUID leaf 04H also reports data that can be used to derive the topology of processor cores in a physical package. This information is constant for all valid index values. Software can query the raw data reported by executing CPUID with EAX=04H and ECX=0 and use it as part of the topology enumeration algorithm described in Chapter 8, “Multiple-Processor Management,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.</p>

<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 05H, the processor returns information about features available to MONITOR/MWAIT instructions. The MONITOR instruction is used for address-range monitoring in conjunction with MWAIT instruction. The MWAIT instruction optionally provides additional extensions for advanced power management. See Table 3-17.</p>
<h2 id="input-eax---06h--returns-thermal-and-power-management-features">INPUT EAX = 06H: Returns Thermal and Power Management Features</h2>

<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 07H and ECX = 0, the processor returns information about the maximum input value for sub-leaves that contain extended feature flags. See Table 3-17.</p>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 07H and the input value of ECX is invalid (see leaf 07H entry in Table 3-17), the processor returns 0 in EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX. In subleaf 0, EAX returns the maximum input value of the highest leaf 7 sub-leaf, and EBX, ECX & EDX contain information of extended feature flags.</p>

<h2 id="input-eax---0bh--returns-extended-topology-information">INPUT EAX = 0BH: Returns Extended Topology Information</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0BH, the processor returns information about extended topology enumeration data. Software must detect the presence of CPUID leaf 0BH by verifying (a) the highest leaf index supported by CPUID is >= 0BH, and (b) CPUID.0BH:EBX[15:0] reports a non-zero value. See Table 3-17.</p>
<h2 id="input-eax---0dh--returns-processor-extended-states-enumeration-information">INPUT EAX = 0DH: Returns Processor Extended States Enumeration Information</h2>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0DH and ECX = 0, the processor returns information about the bit-vector representation of all processor state extensions that are supported in the processor and storage size requirements of the XSAVE/XRSTOR area. See Table 3-17.</p>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0DH and ECX = n (n > 1, and is a valid sub-leaf index), the processor returns information about the size and offset of each processor extended state save area within the XSAVE/XRSTOR area. See Table 3-17. Software can use the forward-extendable technique depicted below to query the valid sub-leaves and obtain size and offset information for each processor extended state save area:</p>
<p>For i = 2 to 62 // sub-leaf 1 is reserved IF (CPUID.(EAX=0DH, ECX=0):VECTOR[i] = 1 ) // VECTOR is the 64-bit value of EDX:EAX Execute CPUID.(EAX=0DH, ECX = i) to examine size and offset for sub-leaf i;FI;</p>

<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0FH and ECX = 0, the processor returns information about the bit-vector representation of QoS monitoring resource types that are supported in the processor and maximum range of RMID values the processor can use to monitor of any supported resource types. Each bit, starting from bit 1, corresponds to a specific resource type if the bit is set. The bit position corresponds to the sub-leaf index (or ResID) that software must use to query QoS monitoring capability available for that type. See Table 3-17.</p>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0FH and ECX = n (n >= 1, and is a valid ResID), the processor returns information software can use to program IA32_PQR_ASSOC, IA32_QM_EVTSEL MSRs before reading QoS data from the IA32_QM_CTR MSR.</p>

<h2 id="the-processor-brand-index-method">The Processor Brand Index Method</h2>
<p>The brand index method (introduced with Pentium® III Xeon® processors) provides an entry point into a brand identification table that is maintained in memory by system software and is accessible from system- and user-level code. In this table, each brand index is associate with an ASCII brand identification string that identifies the official Intel family and model number of a processor.</p>
<p>When CPUID executes with EAX set to 1, the processor returns a brand index to the low byte in EBX. Software can then use this index to locate the brand identification string for the processor in the brand identification table. The first entry (brand index 0) in this table is reserved, allowing for backward compatibility with processors that do not support the brand identification feature. Starting with processor signature family ID = 0FH, model = 03H, brand index method is no longer supported. Use brand string method instead.</p>
